# SissorPaperRock

This is a project that I tried to complete through the Odin project. 
This set of code however does not execute the way its supposed to. 
There is a bug that I cannot identify. Would appreacite it if someone with better eyes can source out the error. 

This is a link to the instructions that I recieved from the odin project to create this game if that helps at all.

I have also attempted to make different versions
of this game but however the if statements arent seeming to do what they are intended to.
